# Synthesized Brainstorming Ideas

## Idea 1: Real-time Collaboration (High Consensus)
Enable multiple users to edit documents simultaneously with intelligent conflict resolution.

**Key Features**:
- Operational Transformation (OT) algorithm for conflict resolution
- WebSocket-based real-time synchronization
- User presence and cursor tracking
- Smart merge strategies

**Consensus**: Both models agreed on this feature with similar implementation approaches.

## Idea 2: Privacy-First AI Assistant (High Consensus)
Integrated AI assistant with strong privacy guarantees.

**Key Features**:
- Context-aware, intelligent suggestions
- On-device/local processing where possible
- End-to-end encryption for AI interactions
- Multi-language support

**Consensus**: Both models prioritized privacy, with slight differences in implementation details (on-device vs encrypted cloud).

## Idea 3: Offline-First Architecture (High Consensus)
Full offline functionality with automatic synchronization.

**Key Features**:
- Local-first data architecture
- Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
- Incremental/background sync when online
- Optimistic UI updates

**Consensus**: Perfect alignment on CRDT-based approach and local-first principles.
